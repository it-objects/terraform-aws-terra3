It can be used to configure and provision a complete stack with</p><ul><li><p>a static website served from S3 and AWS Cloudfront</p></li><li><p>a containerized backend/API running on AWS ECS</p></li><li><p>an AWS RDS MySQL database</p></li></ul><p>It is the result of many projects we did for customers with similar requirements. And rather than starting from scratch with every project, we&#39;ve created reusable Terraform modules. What started as an internal library, now evolved into a single module we&#39;d like to share and to give back to the community as open source.</p><p><strong>Features</strong></p><p>These are module features that allow cloud engineers to customize the AWS infrastructure setup, mostly by just setting the appropriate flag.</p><ul><li><p>NAT instance as optional low-cost alternative to NAT Gateway</p></li><li><p>Reasonable defaults such as &quot;Enabled VPC Gateway endpoint for S3&quot;, &quot;account-wide S3/EBS encryption&quot;</p></li><li><p>Database access for devs without SSH but via an SSM enabled bastion host</p></li><li><p>ECS Exec to quickly shell into a container in a debug stage</p></li><li><p>Optional multi-state Terraform to separate infrastructure from application deployment using AWS Parameter Store</p></li><li><p>Least privileged IAM roles and security groups settings</p></li><li><p>Transport encryption between Cloudfront and the Application Loadbalancer (if custom_domain is enabled)</p></li><li><p>and many more...</p></li></ul><p><strong>Beta phase</strong> While the internal sub-modules are used by us in production, the single Terraform module, that bundles all sub-modules behind neat module parameters such as app_modules and containers, is a completely new development. It should be considered as beta for now, until we release the first major version, expected to be generally available in 2022. Subscribe to the GitHub project to hear about the release!
